# Violet

Violet is a novel identity protocol.  Its storage layer is Cardano.  It currently runs on a publicly callable swarm network that is available for queries by any participating application, internet or otherwise, that requires high availability and uncompromising security.  Identity writes to the transactions layer (Cardano) are permissionless.  As nodes scale and participation increases, the high-availability query layer will be in the hands of additional public node operators. 

# Introduction

A sound identity is context-dependent - it incorporates person, place and time.  A sound identity is maximally fraud-resistant yet freely composable.  Our objective is 100% identity sovereignty.  We currently straddle a divide between this ideal and practical implementation as we push toward the ideal.
