# Violet

Violet is a novel identity protocol.  Its storage layer is Cardano.  It currently runs on a swarm network that is available for use by any application, internet or otherwise, that requires a sound identity protocol. 

# Introduction

A sound identity is context-dependent - it incorporates person, place and time.  A sound identity is non-fraudulent and freely composable.  In ideally free societies, persons have 100% identity sovereignty.  We currently straddle a divide between this ideal and practical implementation.
